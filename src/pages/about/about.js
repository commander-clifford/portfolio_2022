            <p className="art__stagger-in art__stagger-out">
              I started my career with a tour in the Navy where I studied electronics engineering. During my enlistment I learned a lot about electronics, complex systems, and team work. I later received an honorable discharge from the Navy.

            <p className="art__stagger-in art__stagger-out">
              Shortly after, I joined a Department of Defense Contractor. There I worked on the Navy's shipboard CCTV systems as the lead engineer for prototyping and building the next generation of broadcast studio systems for larger Navy vessels.
              This was a great career, but I knew I wanted more. So I decided to go back to school. After a few years as a full time student, while still working, I earned a degree in Web Design as the Valedictorian of my class.

              I've been contracting with some of the best companies in the world. I really appreciate the opportunity I've had to see the industry from so many different perspectives. I have done a lot of contract work, but I will ultimately be in search of a long term platform to focus my efforts on. One where I can contribute while also mentoring junior technologists.

              I've been working with digital media for over 10 years and have a passion for user centered design & innovation. My enthusiasm for design is the interaction and the connection made between the user and the solution. A background in design and engineering have me think with an artistic and scientific mindset, bringing a unique perspective to the table.
              I've been working with digital media for over 10 years and have a passion for design & innovation with the user at the center of everything. I can communicate concepts by rapidly prototyping delightful and engaging experiences, utilizing front-end technologies for high-fidelity and production ready results. I can also work independently on multiple projects, and incorporate feedback from team members across an organization.
              I've studied engineering, psychology and design. In 2014 I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Web Design with a 4.0 GPA as Valedictorian. Today, my favorite exercise is collaborating with team members to design and build game changing experiences from the ground up.




              This makes me fit for a somewhat niche position as a 'Creative Technologist'. My ideal role is one where I'm exploring the boundaries of how humans and computers connect.
              I can contribute to cross functional teams, work independently on multiple projects and incorporate feedback from team members across an organization. My specialty is bringing ideas and innovations to life, technically and as quickly as possible. By rapidly prototyping delightful and engaging experiences, utilizing cutting edge technologies for high-fidelity results.
